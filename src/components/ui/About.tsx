        I specialize in building clean, fast, and user-centric web experiences. My focus is on clarity, balance, and precision—ensuring every element on a page exists for a reason and serves a distinct purpose.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        My work blends modern web technologies with a deep focus on user experience (UX). This approach allows me to design systems that are minimal yet impactful, structured yet intuitive. I build digital products that don’t just look polished, but actually communicate, convert, and intuitively guide the user.
